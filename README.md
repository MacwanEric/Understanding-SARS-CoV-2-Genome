# Understanding-SARS-CoV-2-Genome

This was a learning project; I wanted to understand the virus better, and how better to understand it than to look at its code?

It turns out that you can get reasonably far just using basic Python functions, so I decided against using any libraries. You can get the same results faster using libraries, but... I wanted to learn.
